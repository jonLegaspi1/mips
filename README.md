# mips

Implemented a MIPS like processor using VHDL. Incldes necessary components such as RAM for instructions, registers implemented through an array, and an ALU to handle arithmetic operations. Able to handle R-type, I-type, and jump/branch instructions through instruction fetch, decode, execute, and write-back cycle.
Simulated/tested using ModelSim-Altera. Ensured synthesizable code by
compiling project in Quartus Lite and programmed to DE10-Lite (MAX 10) FPGA board.
Includes several test benches used to ensure functionality.
